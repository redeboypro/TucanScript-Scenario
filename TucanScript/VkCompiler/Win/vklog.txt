vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pSignalSemaphores[0] (VkSemaphore 0x140000000014) is being signaled by VkQueue 0x233e03394c0, but it may still be in use by VkSwapchainKHR 0x20000000002.
Here are the most recently acquired image indices: [0], 1, 2.
(brackets mark the last use of VkSemaphore 0x140000000014 in a presentation operation)
Swapchain image 0 was presented but was not re-acquired, so VkSemaphore 0x140000000014 may still be in use and cannot be safely reused with image index 2.
Vulkan insight: One solution is to assign each image its own semaphore. Here are some common methods to ensure that a semaphore passed to vkQueuePresentKHR is not in use and can be safely reused:
        a) Use a separate semaphore per swapchain image. Index these semaphores using the index of the acquired image.
        b) Consider the VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1 extension. It allows using a VkFence with the presentation operation.

The Vulkan spec states: If semaphore is not VK_NULL_HANDLE, it must not have any uncompleted signal or wait operations pending (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.313.2/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/VK_KHR_surface/wsi.html#VUID-vkAcquireNextImageKHR-semaphore-01779)

vkQueueSubmit(): pSubmits[0].pWaitSemaphores[0] queue (VkQueue 0x233e03394c0) is waiting on semaphore (VkSemaphore 0x160000000016) that has no way to be signaled.
The Vulkan spec states: All elements of the pWaitSemaphores member of all elements of pSubmits created with a VkSemaphoreType of VK_SEMAPHORE_TYPE_BINARY must reference a semaphore signal operation that has been submitted for execution and any semaphore signal operations on which it depends must have also been submitted for execution (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.4.313.2/windows/antora/spec/latest/chapters/cmdbuffers.html#VUID-vkQueueSubmit-pWaitSemaphores-03238)
